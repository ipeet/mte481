  <p>The PCBs have arrived and look exactly as ordered. Now we are just waiting on delivery of all the components and the boards can be soldered and assembled for testing! Code to run on the microcontroller is almost complete as well.</p>

  <h2>Kinect Obstacle-Detection Code</h2>

  <p>Some preliminary obstacle-detection code has been written for the Kinect to run under ROS on a laptop. The colour image shows the group members, and the greyscale image is a grid showing where obstacles have been detected (in black). As can be seen floor/ceiling obstacles are rejected but the three humans in the picture have been detected as obstacles.</p>

  <h2>Sensor Testing</h2>
  <img src="static/testing.jpg" width="300" alt="Blog Image" align=float/>
  <p>A Kinect sensor was purchased, and a set of sonar sensors borrowed for testing as shown in the image. We set up markers on the floor and measured the coverage of various sensor configurations. We found out two important things: we will need sensors with the largest beam angle possible and also that we will have measure ranges sequentially as we ran into a lot of sensor crosstalk issues during testing!</p>
