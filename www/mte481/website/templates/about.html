<h1>Wheel Chair Collision Avoidance System</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>

<p class="sidenote">
The MTE 481 &amp; 482 courses for the Mechatronics program at the University of Waterloo are courses designed to have students prove their engineering skills by developing and producing a prototype of a product. Students consider the development of a product in terms of meeting a need, for marketing, as well as technical content, as well as assessing the patentability of the end product. The students the create a prototype and demo it to professors and industry partners in a symposium to be held on March 19, 2012.</p>

<p>Powered wheel chairs have obvious benefits for the mobility of the physically disabled. Operation of any relatively heavy powered vehicle carries certain safety risks and operators must be capable of safe operation. 
</p>
<p>
We spoke with a member of the industy in order to verify the need for collision-avoidance for powered wheel chairs. A physiotherapist in the employ of the British Columbia Interior Health Authority, Irene Ruel, who has previously been responsible for powered wheel chair assessments in an extended care facility, was consulted regarding this problem. By her account, the risk that powered wheelchair operators will collide with other patients is a serious concern and frequently results in the denial of requests for powered wheel chairs for patients living in care facilities. This encouraged our team to develop a wheel chair that helps improve this situation by meeting the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Improve Safety.</i>Safety is a significant concern for powered wheelchair operation. Effective safety
systems will be of great value to those with physical disabilities.</li>
<li><i>Improve accessibility.</i>For those who would be denied access to a powered wheelchair, a safety system
which permits access will have significant quality-of-life benefits.</li>
<li><i>Assist with dificult tasks.</i>Some tasks, such as precise positioning and movement in constrained spaces,
are dificult even for unimpaired operators. A system which can assist with such tasks would be helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these in mind we set out a couple of simple constraints that the design would also need to meet in order to be both applicable and usable.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Insensitive to operating environment.</i>Realistic operating environments will be varied, and subject to change (examples could be light levels or the ambient temperature). The usefulness of a safety system will be severely degraded if it depends on a specialized,
controlled environment.</li>
<li><i>Integrates with existing wheelchairs.</i>Powered wheelchairs are expensive, and many are already in
existence. Rather than re-inventing the wheel (or wheel-chair in this case) it makes sense to build on existing products by making this an "add-on" feature to an existing chair.</li>
<li><i>Cost kept to a minimum.</i>The system will be paid for by individuals, who will be sensitive to cost. It will be difficult to market a system which is very expensive relative to the cost of a basic powered wheelchair. Initial talks with one pysiotherapist resulted in a suggested cost of not more than $500 for a system (on top of the base cost of the wheelchair).</li>
</ul>
