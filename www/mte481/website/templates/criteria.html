<h2>Criteria</h2>

<h3 style="background-color:blue;">Weight</h3>
<p style="background-color:blue;">Weight is an important criterion as a number of powered wheel chairs have weight limitations. This should
be as small as possible since the weight capacity of a chair like 
<a href="http://www.invacare.ca/cgi-bin/imhqprd/inv_catalog/prod_cat_detail.jsp?s=0&prodID=R51LXP&catOID=-536887496">
the Invacare Neutron R51LXP</a> is 300 pounds. This means that for any weight we add on to the wheel chair we reduce 
the potential carrying load of the wheel chair and with it our potential market.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:blue;">Size</h3>
<p style="background-color:blue;">Size is a minor criterion we considered, with an excessively large bulky attachment it would reduce the
mobility of the wheel chair and decrease the number of places the wheel chair can travel to. It may also get
in the way of the user when operating the wheel chair. This made it important to have some size criteria for
measuring the strength of a design.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:blue;">Durability</h3>
<p style="background-color:blue;">While most of the system should not be placed under continuous strain or be at high risk of damage, it is
important to consider how durable the design is as there will be wear and tear from use of this system on a
wheel chair and damage occurred from movement around the wheel chair.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:green;">Price</h3>
<p style="background-color:green;">Price is an important factor for our consideration since we plan to market it to the end users and not to
corporations that may have larger budgets. This then made it the most important ranking and with the very
large dierence in sensor costs it made for a very important factor in determining which route to take.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:green;">Power Consumption</h3>
<p style="background-color:green;">Power Consumption measure how much an addition will add to the power consumption of the wheel chair.
Many of these chairs are run off of an onboard battery and draining this battery quickly will signifcantly
reduce its usefulness to the users.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:green;">Processing Requirements</h3>
<p style="background-color:green;">The amount of computational intelligence required to handle the data that is coming in from the sensor.
This is to make distinction between sensors similar to a Kinect which uses USB and would be plugged into
a laptop that will be needed to interpret the data versus something like a sonar sensor that could be tuned
and used on FPGA. This will run opposite the Quantity of Useful Data.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:pink;">Quantity of useful Data</h3>
<p style="background-color:pink;">This was selected to distinguish things like sonar which provide simply a distance mapping for a cone versus
something like LIDAR, which provides a high-resolution, narrow-beam distance scan. The more data we get
from a sensor the more we can make use of it to recognize and avoid obstacles. This runs as the opposite of
processing requirements, since more data requires more processing power to interpret the data.</p>

<h3  style="background-color:pink;">Range</h3>
<p style="background-color:pink;">The range for the detection of objects is fairly important to us. While range beyond 7-8 meters is not
particularly useful, we want range from about 0 to 8 meters optimally. For this we assume they are working
in optimal conditions which we said to be indoors and with normal lighting. Certain sensors we consider
have signicantly reduced range in other conditions.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:pink;">Precision</h3>
<p style="background-color:pink;">Precision is fairly important since we are detecting obstacles and we would like to know how far away they
are, noise and disturbances are acceptable to a small degree so long as we can identify them as noise and
not a fast moving obstacle. In addition to this its important that some sensors have decreased precision at
increased range. This is noted as a small reduction in their score.</p>
