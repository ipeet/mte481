\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
Powered wheelchairs have obvious benefits for the mobility of the physically disabled.  As relatively heavy, powered vehicles, operation of these wheelchairs also carries obvious risk.  Thus, operators must be capable of safe operations.

Irene Ruel, a physiotherapist in the employ of the British Columbia Interior Health Authority, who has previously been responsible for powered wheelchair assessments in an extended care facilities, was consulted regarding this problem.  By her account, the risk that powered wheelchair operators will collide with other patients is a serious concern, which frequently results in the denial of requests for powered wheelchairs.

\section{Need Statement}
Access to powered wheelchairs may be restricted due to concerns about a patient's capability for safe operation.

\section{Objectives and Constraints}
The objectives of this design problem are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Improve safety}.  Safety is a significant concern for powered wheelchair operation.  Effective safety systems will be of great value to those with physical disabilities.
 \item \emph{Improve accessibility}.  For those who would be denied access to a powered wheelchair, a safety system which permits access will have significant quality-of-life benefits.
 \item \emph{Assist with difficult tasks}. Some tasks, such as precise positioning and movement in constrained spaces, are difficult even for unimpaired operators.   A system which can assist with such tasks would be helpful.
\end{itemize}

The constraints of the design are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Insensitive to operating environment}.  Realistic operating environments will be varied, and subject to change.  The usefulness of a safety system will be severely degraded if it depends on a specialized, controlled environment.
 \item \emph{Integrates with existing wheelchairs}.  Powered wheelchairs are expensive, and many are already in existence.  The potential reach of a new safety system will be severely restricted if it may not be integrated with pre-existing wheelchairs.
 \item \emph{Cost kept below \$500}.  The system will be paid for by end users, who will be sensitive to cost.  It will be difficult to market a system which is very expensive relative to the cost of a basic powered wheelchair.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{schedule} shows the prototype production gantt chart.  It may be seen that the prototype is expected to be completed about a week before the March 14 symposium.  The timeline is dominated by electrical and software tasks; if possible, it would be especially advantageous to begin electrical design work early.
